Draw your definition of distant reading on the white board. 

Let's compare different kinds of text analysis. 

Using Part 2 and Part 3 of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. Write 2-3 sentences outling his method(s). 

* First, in order to clean up the data, Belvin made all casing uniform "to distill words into a basic unit"
* Then, tracked whether or not birth appeared in the first column of Ballard's data and filtered further from there to discover the stated number of births per year recorded in the diary
* Compared his figures with Ulrich's chart in <i>A Midwife's Tale</i>, in which he found a 4.86% deviation between the manual findings and computing findings for recorded births per year.

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| xxxxxxxxxxx   | yyyyyyyyyyyy  |
| zzzzzzzzzzz   | zzzzzzzzzz    |

3.  Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's  "distant reading"?


Using the Topic Modeling section of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. Write 2-3 sentences outling his method(s). 

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| xxxxxxxxxxx (Blevins, 10/19/2009)  | yyyyyyyyyyyy  |
| zzzzzzzzzzz   | zzzzzzzzzz  (Brett, Vol 2 2012)  |

Now use Brett's piece to add to this table. 

3. Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's "distant reading"?


Before we take a look at [Mining the Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/):
 - What topics would expect to see?
 - Which words would you expect to see in each topic?
 - Is Mining the Dispatch "distant reading"?


Next Tuesday, we are going to add to this table based on the readings.
