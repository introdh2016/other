Draw your definition of distant reading on the white board. 

Let's compare different kinds of text analysis. 

Using Part 2 and Part 3 of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. For text analysis, Blevins changed all the words to lower case with no punctuation so the computer could read it, and then the computer would read the columns and note if the diary included events marked with "birth" or variations thereof. That way he could specific events, like births, over time and compare them in terms of year/month/day of the week. Sparklines of certain words allows Blevins to track the frequency of specific words over time, like "surveying" and "god." 

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Able to access specific pieces of information and compare them across entries   | With name changes and word changes, close reading is needed to recognize those changes and tell the computer  |
| Able to see changes over time quickly - without human error   | Correlation does not equal causation    |

3.  Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's  "distant reading"? Yes, but because of the diary, Blevins has to do close reading in order to get accurate information. 

Using the Topic Modeling section of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. Blevins would take the diary and convert it into text, and MALLET would produce different word topics, which Blevins gave a descriptive label. MALLET did not note the use of the word, but rather which words frequently occurred and when. Words would be grouped together, and Blevins can track larger trends over time such as gardening in summer months or housework in her later years through topic modeling, rather than specific words and sparklines. 

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Can track large trends across time (Blevins, 10/19/2009)  | Some words humans intuitively group together a computer won't which can create some problems  |
| Unbiased reading of the text   | Algorithms need to be right, and visualizations need to be understandable or the data can be messy and unreadble  (Brett, Vol 2 2012)  |

Now use Brett's piece to add to this table. 

3. Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's "distant reading"? Yes, he is distant reading by separating the text and not doing a close and thorough reading, but at the same time he did do a close reading in order to double check what the computer program produced.


Before we take a look at [Mining the Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/):
 - What topics would expect to see?
 - Which words would you expect to see in each topic?
 - Is Mining the Dispatch "distant reading"?


Next Tuesday, we are going to add to this table based on the readings.
