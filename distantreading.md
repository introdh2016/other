Draw your definition of distant reading on the white board. 

Let's compare different kinds of text analysis. 

Using Part 2 and Part 3 of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. Blevins changed all the words to lower case with no punctuation so the computer could read it, and then the computer would read the columns and note if the diary included events marked with "birth" or variations thereof. Then he would be able to see the amount of deliviries attended or other "buzzwords" for events in her life, and note changes over time with the births attended or language used.

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Able to access specific pieces of information and compare them across entries   | With name changes and word changes, close reading is needed to recognize those changes and tell the computer  |
| Able to see changes over time quickly - without human error   | Correlation does not equal causation    |

3.  Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's  "distant reading"?
Yes, but because of the diary, Blevins has to do close reading in order to get accurate information. 

Using the Topic Modeling section of Blevin's Martha Ballard Diary blog posts, do the following:

1. Write 2-3 sentences outling his method(s). 

2. Create a list of pros/possibiliites and cons/ limitations of the method(s) used. 

| Pros/ Possibiliies | Cons/ Limitations | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| xxxxxxxxxxx (Blevins, 10/19/2009)  | yyyyyyyyyyyy  |
| zzzzzzzzzzz   | zzzzzzzzzz  (Brett, Vol 2 2012)  |

Now use Brett's piece to add to this table. 

3. Based on Moretti's work, is Blevin's "distant reading"?


Before we take a look at [Mining the Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/):
 - What topics would expect to see?
 - Which words would you expect to see in each topic?
 - Is Mining the Dispatch "distant reading"?


Next Tuesday, we are going to add to this table based on the readings.
